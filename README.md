## Getting Started

Get started with the Tax Quote Generator by following these steps:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher):** JavaScript runtime environment.
- **[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) package manager:**  Used to install project dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   Open your terminal and clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/geormdude/client_quote.git](https://github.com/geormdude/client_quote.git)
   cd client_quote
````

2. **Install dependencies:**

    Navigate into the cloned project directory (`client_quote`) and install the required npm packages:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or if you prefer yarn:
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

1. **Start the development server:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server with:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```

2. **Access the application:**

    Open your web browser and go to the address displayed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`). The application should now be running, and you can start using the Tax Quote Generator.

## Usage

Using the Tax Quote Generator is straightforward:

1. **Upload Tax Return PDF:**

      - **Drag and Drop:** Drag your Form 1040 PDF file and drop it into the designated area on the application.
      - **Click to Upload:** Alternatively, click the "upload" button to open a file dialog and select your Form 1040 PDF file.

2. **Automatic Analysis:**

      - Once the PDF is uploaded, the application automatically begins analyzing the tax return.
      - No manual initiation of the analysis is required.

3. **Review Complexity Assessment and Quote:**

      - After the analysis is complete, the application will display:
          - A complexity assessment of the tax return (e.g., Basic, Intermediate, Advanced).
          - A generated quote based on the complexity.

4. **Real-time Processing Status:**

      - During the PDF processing and analysis, a progress indicator will be displayed in real-time.
      - This provides visual feedback on the application's current status and processing progress.

## Technical Details

### Tax Return Analysis

The application intelligently analyzes Form 1040 tax returns by evaluating the presence and complexity of various income sources, tax schedules, and deductions. The key components analyzed include:

- **Income Sources**

  - **W-2 Employment Income:**  Detects and analyzes W-2 forms for employment income.
  - **1099-NEC (Self-employment):** Identifies self-employment income reported on Form 1099-NEC.
  - **1099-DIV (Dividends):**  Analyzes dividend income from Form 1099-DIV.
  - **1099-INT (Interest):**  Detects and processes interest income from Form 1099-INT.

- **Tax Schedules**

  - **Schedule B (Interest and Dividends):**  Checks for the presence of Schedule B, indicating detailed interest or dividend income.
  - **Schedule C (Business Income):**  Detects Schedule C, signifying business income or loss from a sole proprietorship.
  - **Schedule D (Capital Gains):**  Analyzes Schedule D for capital gains and losses from investments.
  - **Schedule E (Rental Income):**  Identifies Schedule E, indicating income or loss from rental properties, royalties, partnerships, S corporations, estates, and trusts.

- **Deductions**

  - **Charitable Contributions:**  Evaluates the complexity related to charitable contribution deductions.
  - **Mortgage Interest:**  Analyzes deductions for mortgage interest expenses.
  - **Medical Expenses:**  Assesses the complexity associated with medical expense deductions.

### Complexity Scoring

The application employs a weighted scoring system to determine the overall complexity of a tax return:

- **Schedule Presence:**  Each detected tax schedule (Schedule B, C, D, E) adds a significant complexity weight:

  - **Ã—2 multiplier per schedule**

- **Specific Income and Deduction Types:**

  - **Business income (Schedule C):**  +3 points
  - **Rental property (Schedule E):**  +2 points
  - **Investment Complexity Levels (Schedule D):**
    - **Complex Investments:**  +3 points (e.g., complex derivatives, options trading)
    - **Moderate Investments:**  +1 point (e.g., sales of stocks and bonds)
    - **Simple Investments:**  0 points (e.g., basic capital gains)

- **Final Complexity Categories:**

    The total complexity score is used to categorize the tax return into three levels:

  - **Basic:** (score â‰¤ 3) -  Represents simple tax returns, typically with only W-2 income and standard deductions.
  - **Intermediate:** (score 4-6) - Indicates moderately complex returns, potentially including itemized deductions, investment income, or self-employment income.
  - **Advanced:** (score \> 6) -  Signifies highly complex tax returns, often involving multiple schedules, business income, rental properties, and complex investments.

## Security and Privacy

Your privacy and data security are paramount. The Tax Quote Generator is designed with the following security and privacy principles in mind:

- **Client-Side Processing:** All tax return processing is performed directly within your web browser using [PDF.js](https://mozilla.github.io/pdf.js/). This ensures that no sensitive tax data is ever transmitted to external servers.
- **Data Privacy:**  No tax return data leaves your browser during the entire process. The application operates offline once loaded, and no information is sent over the internet.
- **In-Memory Processing:**  Tax return files are processed in-memory and are not stored persistently by the application. Once you close the browser window or refresh the page, all data is cleared from memory.
- **File Validation:**  The application includes built-in file validation to ensure that only valid Form 1040 PDF files are processed. This validation includes checks for file type and size to prevent malicious uploads.
